                    In February 2022, Russia began to invade and occupy parts of Ukraine. This has caused many Ukrainian people to migrate away from Ukraine for their safety. By the end of January 2023, more than eight million people had migrated away from Ukraine.

                    As shown in the pie chart below, there are a wide range of different countries which Ukrainians have migrated to since the beginning of the war. The most common countries for Ukrainians to migrate to are the ones closest geographically. Russia is the country which has taken in the largest number of Ukrainian migrants.

                    As soon as the war began in early 2022, Ukrainians began to migrate away to other countries. The funnel chart below shows the increase in the total number of Ukrainians who have migrated away from Ukraine since the war began. The number of migrants increases sharply during May 2022 to over one million. There is another sharp increase in June 2022 taking the total up to over four million. The number then steadily increases to over eight million in March 2023.

                <p>
                    As the war in Ukraine continues, it is expected that the number of migrants out of Ukraine will only increase. Ukrainians are in a challenging and uncertain situation with no end in sight for the war so far.
